#A hotel wants to develop a table reservation system for their clients to avoid unnecessary waiting. 
#The number of tables and seats per table should be displayed to the clients. 
#The system should be able to automatically reserve a table based on the number of seats required.
#The booking notifications should be sent to the client and the hotel manager. 
#When a customer pays off his bill, the status of that table should change from occupied to available.
#The system should periodically refresh and display the new availability.
